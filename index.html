    <h2>Aquanted with the Night</h2>
    <h4>By ROBERT FROST</h4>
      <p>I have been one acquainted with the night.
        <br>I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
        <br>I have outwalked the furthest city light.</p>
        <p>I have looked down the saddest city lane.
        <br>I have passed by the watchman on his beat
        <br>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</p>
        <p>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
        <br>When far away an interrupted cry
        <br>Came over houses from another street,</p>
        <p>But not to call me back or say good-by e;
        <br>And further still at an unearthly height,
        <br>One luminary clock against the sky</p>
        <p>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
        <br>I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
