    <h2>Clockwork</h2>
      <p>I don't need a wrist clock
      <br>Need not watch the violence</p>
      <p>I can be my own tick tock
      <br>Akin to birthday virus</p>
      <p>Peripheral is sidetracked on their side
      <br>Present there, yet broken and seeping</p>
      <p>Common phrase, "Look on the brightside"
      <br>Perishing and eternal keeping</p>
      <p>Can't say we dream of each other
      <br>Or that we are the same</p>
      <p>Though I know we think like one another
      <br>Forever enduring the name</p>
      <p>They have thier own virus
      <br>Lack of sleep and "on quive"</p>
      <p>Draining is too timeless
      <br>And reality has too much sieve.</p>

      <li><h2>Aquanted with the Night</h2></li>
      <h4>By Robert Frost</h4>
        <p>I have been one acquainted with the <em>night</em>.
          <br>I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
          <br>I have outwalked the furthest city light.</p>
          <p>I have looked down the saddest city lane.
          <br>I have passed by the watchman on his beat
          <br>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</p>
          <p>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
          <br>When far away an interrupted cry
          <br>Came over houses from another street,</p>
          <p>But not to call me back or say good-by e;
          <br>And further still at an unearthly height,
          <br>One luminary clock against the sky</p>
          <p>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
          <br>I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
      <li><h2>Yellowjackeys</h2></li>
      <h4>By Yuesef Komunyakaa</h4>
        <p>When the plowblade struck
        <br>An old stump hiding under
        <br>The soil like a beggar's
        <br>Rotten tooth, they swarmed up
        <br>& Mister Jackson left the plow
        <br>Wedged like a whaler's harpoon.
        <br>The horse was midnight
        <br>Against the dusk, tethered to somebody's
        <br>Pocketwatch. He shivered, but not
        <br>The way women shook their heads
        <br>Before mirrors at the five
        <br>& dine--a deeper connection
        <br>To the low field's evening star.
        <br>He stood there, in tracechains,
        <br>Lathered in froth, just
        <br>Stopped by a great, goofy
        <br>Calmness. He whinnied
        <br>Once, & then the whole
        <br>Beautiful, blue-black sky
        <br>Fell on his back.</p>
