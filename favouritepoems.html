    <h2>Aquanted with the Night</h2>
    <h4>By Robert Frost</h4>
      <p>I have been one acquainted with the night.
        <br>I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
        <br>I have outwalked the furthest city light.</p>
        <p>I have looked down the saddest city lane.
        <br>I have passed by the watchman on his beat
        <br>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</p>
        <p>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
        <br>When far away an interrupted cry
        <br>Came over houses from another street,</p>
        <p>But not to call me back or say good-bye;
        <br>And further still at an unearthly height,
        <br>One luminary clock against the sky</p>
        <p>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
        <br>I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>

    <h2>Yellowjackeys</h2>
    <h4>By Yuesef Komunyakaa</h4>
      <p>When the plowblade struck
      <br>An old stump hiding under
      <br>The soil like a beggar's
      <br>Rotten tooth, they swarmed up
      <br>& Mister Jackson left the plow
      <br>Wedged like a whaler's harpoon.
      <br>The horse was midnight
      <br>Against the dusk, tethered to somebody's
      <br>Pocketwatch. He shivered, but not
      <br>The way women shook their heads
      <br>Before mirrors at the five
      <br>& dine--a deeper connection
      <br>To the low field's evening star.
      <br>He stood there, in tracechains,
      <br>Lathered in froth, just
      <br>Stopped by a great, goofy
      <br>Calmness. He whinnied
      <br>Once, & then the whole
      <br>Beautiful, blue-black sky
      <br>Fell on his back.</p>

    <h2>Burnt Notion (No.1 of "Four Quartets")</h2>
    <h4>By T.S. Eliot</h4>
      <p>Time present and time past
      <br>Are both perhaps present in time future,
      <br>And time future contained in time past.
      <br>If all time is eternally present
      <br>All time is unredeemable.
      <br>What might have been is an abstraction
      <br>Remaining a perpetual possibility
      <br>Only in a world of speculation.
      <br>What might have been and what has been
      <br>Point to one end, which is always present.
      <br>Footfalls echo in the memory
      <br>Down the passage which we did not take
      <br>Towards the door we never opened
      <br>Into the rose-garden. My words echo
      <br>Thus, in your mind.
      <br> &nbsp But to what purpose
      <br>Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves
      <br>I do not know.
      <br>    Other echoes
      <br>Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?
      <br>Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,
      <br>Round the corner. Through the first gate,
      <br>Into our first world, shall we follow
      <br>The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.
      <br>There they were, dignified, invisible,
      <br>Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,
      <br>In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,
      <br>And the bird called, in response to
      <br>The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,
      <br>And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses
      <br>Had the look of flowers that are looked at.
      <br>There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.
      <br>So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,
      <br>Along the empty alley, into the box circle,
      <br>To look down into the drained pool.
      <br>Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,
      <br>And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,
      <br>And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,
      <br>The surface glittered out of heart of light,
      <br>And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.
      <br>Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.
      <br>Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,
      <br>Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.
      <br>Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind
      <br>Cannot bear very much reality.
      <br>Time past and time future
      <br>What might have been and what has been
      <br>Point to one end, which is always present.</p>

    <h2>"Hope" is the thing with feathers</h2>
    <h4>By Emily Dickinson</h4>
      <p>"Hope" is the thing with feathers--
      <br>That perches in the soul--
      <br>And sings the tine without the words--
      <br>And never stops-at all--</p>
      <p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard--
      <br>And sore must be the storm--
      <br>That could abash the little Bird
      <br>That kept so many warm -</p>
      <p>I've heard it in the chillest land -
      <br>And on the strangest Sea -
      <br>Yet - never - in Extremity,
      <br>It asked a crumb - of me.</p>
