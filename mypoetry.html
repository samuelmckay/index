<h2>Clockwork</h2>
  <p>I don't need a wrist clock
  <br>Need not watch the violence</p>
  <p>I can be my own tick tock
  <br>Akin to birthday virus</p>
  <p>Peripheral is sidetracked on their side
  <br>Present there, yet broken and seeping</p>
  <p>Common phase "Look on the bright side"
  <br>Perishing and eternal keeping</p>
  <p>Can't say that we dream on each other
  <br>Or that we are the same</p>
  <p>Though I know we think like on another
  <br>Forever enduring the name</p>
  <p>They have their own virus
  <br>Lack of sleep and "On quive"</p>
  <p>Draining is too timelese
  <br>And reality has too much sieve.</p>

<h2>Untitled #1</h2>
    <p>The Man was struggling with the rabbit
    <br>Goddamnit, we could walk on the moon-
    <br>pick at craterous acne-
    <br>but we can't tune to Wheel of Fortune?
    <br>Scrambling our perception of miracles
    <br>We could probably do without the satellite signals</p>

<h2>lemon garden</h2>
  <p>that lemon garden fool,
  <br>who sees the flower's bloom;
  <br>and with such expansive piety, too.
  <br>he watched as they rise and fall,
  <br>and thinks zilch of it all.
  <br>but once the flower begins the crawl
  <br>to his calloused green hands,
  <br>that fool begins to understand
  <br>the flower's blooming despite commands
  <br>from the gardener and the flourist
  <br>with desires of the purest
  <br>into the ugly hands of "your dearest."
  <br>that lemon garden fool—
  <br>the one used as a tool
  <br>to stop the wilt and bloom—
  <br>allowed one flower to stay
  <br>to bloom as it may
  <br>hidden from the stains of doom.</p>

  <h2>Untitled #2</h2>
    <p>Days in the sun —
    <br>time runs effortlessly,
    <br>seen only by lightning;
    <br>(might be) gone by now.</p>
    <p>Somehow the season
    <br>passes by like a train
    <br>on track, gone by fast;
    <br>derailed at the last moment.
    <br>puffs of smoke —
    <br>clouds —</p>
    <p>Cover the sun.</p>

  <h2>Found Poem #1 — from Stephen King's <em>It</em></h2>
  <p>His mother exclaimed, more than once:</p>
  <p>"You could build a clock
  <br>that really told time."</p>
  <p>"Lonely?" he might have asked in return,</p>
  <p>Honestly foozled.</p>
  <p>A child blind from birth</p>
  <p>Doesn't know he's blind
  <br>until someone tells him.</p>
  <p>But, lonliness both encompassed his life,</p>
  <p>And overreached it:
  <br>It simply was.</p>
  <p>A sweet dream; the candy was</p>
  <p>A sweet reality.</p>
  <p>Most of all, to shoot them into his mouth</p>
  <p>One by one, like a kid
  <br>committing suicide by sugar.</p>
  <p>It was really two buildings,</p>
  <p>The old stone structure in front.</p>
