  <h2>About This Blog</h2>
    <p>My name is Samuel McKay. I'm 19, Laxgibuu (wolf), and I come from the community of Gitlaxt'aamiks. This is my poetry blog site.
    <br>I've had a deep appreciation for reading for the most part of my life, an appreciation which has brought into fruition a deep appreciation for all aspects and forms of literature.
    <br>While I love the power of the pen behind fictional and non-fictional writing, the art of poetry has carved out a special place for itself in my heart.
    <br>With the task of creating my first webpage, I thought it would be fun to build a space for me to not only share some of my writing, but writings that have inspired me as well.</p>
